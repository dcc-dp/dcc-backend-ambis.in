"""One-off backfill: compute embeddings for curriculum_chunks rows missing one.

`curriculum_chunks.embedding` is deliberately NOT mapped in the CurriculumChunk
ORM model (see app/models/curriculum.py — pgvector ORM support is deferred), so
this script talks to that column via raw SQL only, same pattern as
StateManager's atomic UPSERT.

Provider: gemini-embedding-001 via 9router, truncated to 768 dims via the
`dimensions` param to match the existing vector(768) column with no schema
migration. See Decisions/2026-09-16 - Embedding model gemini-embedding-001 via
9router (vault) for why. LLMClient.embed() re-normalizes the truncated output
to unit length before this script ever sees it.

This is a manual script, not part of the test suite or CI — same category as
eval/run_eval.py. It writes to the real, shared Supabase DB, so run it
deliberately, not as a side effect of something else.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.backfill_embeddings
